\section{Implementation, Integration and Test Plan}
\subsection{Overview}
\vspace{0.5cm}
This section will discuss the implementation, integration and testing of the CLup application. The section aims to prevent any setbacks entailing changes on the project once started its development and do multiple tasks twice.\\

We all make mistakes. Some of those mistakes are not important, but some are expensive, so the phase of verification and validation takes an important role. Thus, we try to find as many as bugs possible until the release day.

\subsection{Implementation Strategy}
\vspace{0.5cm}

First of all, it is important to divide the project into smaller components in order to have more concrete goals that help keep the developers’ motivation high and make a straightforward development of the project. Therefore, we will divide the project in different components, starting from the ones that are responsible of the basic features and going on until the end, where we will develop the most specific ones. It is not a new method, because it has been studied during this course and it is referred to as ‘bottom-up’ strategy. This method will help providing a better integration of the project tier-by-tier and make different tests of the behaviour of the application before it ends.
