\subsubsection{User Interface}
% \input{parts/section2/pp.tex}
The application that we are using should be able to generate QR codes and will appear in the screen for customers to use. before that, we assume that users already inserted the specific shop they want to go and also choose between two mode of lining up and book a visit for that supermarket later. the app show  estimated time and the number of people before that user so they can save their time and  mange their life better. after all they will scan their QR code and enter the supermarket.
A smartphone and within that, the application, is the suitable thing that answer the needs.
the following mockups give the idea of:
1. The logo of the application looks like;
2. The splash screens;
3. And the 4 first pages of the application;

Other mockups will be presented in the Design Document part for User Interfaces.
\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The software application contains three main functions and two types of actors, which require different
kinds of hardware interfaces.

• Regarding BS:
The users must own a smartphone in order to generate QR codes to access supermarkets. They
can also use a ticket machine for this purpose so that they can have the code in person.
The managers, instead, can access the system only through the App using a smartphone.They first have to register themselves to the system and then add their shops to the system. there is also a scanner which scan the validity of the tickets.

• Regarding AF1 : for booking a visit, users should have smartphone to get their QR codes otherwise they cannot use this feature.
\subsubsection{software Interfaces}
The system uses the following external interfaces:

City map
We assume that the system uses a public API to provide:
1. to the customer the possibility to see the shops location by selecting its branch name.
2. to the manager to add their shops location to the system

notification server:
This app has a system which it sends notification to customers when their turn is close 

estimation time:
The application shows an estimated time in which users can manage their time to be on the spot in time.

Communication Interfaces:
The device connects to CLup via internet connection.
