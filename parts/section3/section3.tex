\subsubsection{User Interface}
% \input{parts/section2/pp.tex}
The application that we are using should be able to generate QR codes and will appear in the screen for customers to use. before that, we assume that users already inserted the specific shop they want to go and also choose between two mode of lining up and book a visit for that supermarket later. the app show  estimated time and the number of people before that user so they can save their time and  mange their life better. after all they will scan their QR code and enter the supermarket.
A smartphone and within that, the application, is the suitable thing that answer the needs.
the following mockups give the idea of:
1. the logo of the application looks like;
2. the splash screens;
3. and the 3 first pages of the application;
