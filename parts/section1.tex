\paragraph{}
It also includes the research about the interfaces, functional and non-functional requirements and the attributes that distinguish the quality of the system.

\paragraph{}
This document has the purpose to guide the developer in the realization of the software called CLup, a Customers Line-up application.

\paragraph{}
Finally, to understand better the development of the document, it contains the history that describes how it is made, with the references used and the description of its structure.
